# PitchingPredictionModel
A frequentist approach to pitch prediction and tendencies

Uses current savant pitching data to build heatmaps and most likely pitch tables for each pitcher based on hitter handedness and counts.

"Most Likely Pitch" function can extend infinitely (or technically up to the number of pitch types * 14 zones).

Each chart contains pitch type, zone, number of times that pitch has been thrown in that zone in that count, and the % that that pitch has been thrown in that zone in that count.

Currently an error with zones. Fixing grid to better resemble actual zone.
