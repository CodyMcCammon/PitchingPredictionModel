# PitchingPredictionModel
A frequentist approach to pitch prediction and tendencies

Uses current savant pitching data to build heatmaps and most likely pitch tables for each pitcher based on hitter handedness and counts.

"Most Likely Pitch" function can extend infinitely (or technically up to the number of pitch types * 14 zones).

Each chart contains pitch time, zone, nunmber of times that pitch has been thrown in that zone, and the % that that pitch has been thrown in that zone in that count.
